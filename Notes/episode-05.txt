There are two types of export/import, default and named.


Whenever a state variable updates, react re-renders the component

React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination
 of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and
 gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work 
 into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

 Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in;
  the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.


Reconciliation

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level
description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that
describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering 
environment â€” for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM
operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree 
is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

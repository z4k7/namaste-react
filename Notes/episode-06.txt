Monolith and Microservice Architecture

In monolithic architecture every functionality or services will be inside one big bulk project. 
Where as in Microservice architecture each service will be seperated into different projects and this
is known as "Seperation of concerns". It also follows "Single Responsibility Principle", which means 
that no service will interfere with another service.

When to make an API call

- When our app loads we will make api call, wait for the response and then render the page

- When our app loads, we render whatever is available , for example show a skeleton, then make api call
 and when we get response we will re-render the page

 We will stick on to the second approach. But you might be thinking that we are rendering twice and wont it affect the performance.
 No my dear friend, that is the beauty of react. The render cycle of React is very fast, so it doesnt affect the performance


 UseEffect Hook

 Hooks are normal javascript functions with specific usecases. We use useEfect hook for making api calls. useEffect takes two 
 arguments, first one is a callback function and second one is a dependency array.

 useEffect hook will be called after our page is rendered 

 Definition of state react variable?

 Whenever a state react variable updates, react triggers a reconciliation cycle (re-renders the entire component)

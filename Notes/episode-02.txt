There are two types of dependencies
Dev depenency
It is generally required in our development phase

Normal Dependency 
It is used in production also


What is a bundler?
Bundlers are used to bundle all our files into one file so as to push it into production. Example for bundlers
are : Webpack, vite and parcel.
Here we are using parcel as our bundler.

There are two types of prefixes  for the package version in package.json.
=> (~) Tilde
It automatically ugrades the package into its new major version

=> (^) Caret
It automatically upgrades the package into its new minor versions

Package Lock json
It keeps track of all the versions of the dependencies that are installed in our project

What is transitive dependency?
When we install a dependency, for example by using 'npm i parcel', the dependency can have
its own dependency and that dependencies can have their own dependencies and so on.. and 
all these dependencies will be stored in the node modules and as a result the node modules will be having lot of files in it.


Just like we have npm we have something known as npx. npm is used in cases where we want to get 
or install a package but npx is used to execute a package.
